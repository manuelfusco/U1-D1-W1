            <p>
                <span>Biography</span> <br> Hello to everyone, I feel luck that you are reading me here, because it
                means
                that
                finally I'm skilling myself for the Digital Wolrd we are going to!
                I'm a 24yo italian boy. Let's tell you something about me: I grew up in Agerola, a little on the
                Amalfi Coast (South Italy), in a commerciant family: my father is anentrepreneur and my mother is a
                seamstress.
                In the time course, until today, they twitch some job: for 10year they manage a restaurant and a b&b.
                Differntly to my three brothers ( two major and one minore ) that follow the family craft, since I was
                little I had a passione for all the form of
                human
                art, that could be the cooking, the painting and, in my opinion, the informatica too. Cause this
                passione to
                the possibility of human mind creation, after the normal scholastic journey, I choose to go tu study
                Psychology in Padua, a city in the North Italy.
                I'v reahced my bachelors degree tha last december: I was very happy, but after that I realize that
                university doesn't give all the necessary tool and skill to front the job market.
                My biggest dream is to become a researcher Psychoterapist, expert of the functioning of human mind
                dynamic.
                For the realization of my dream, I am aware that I can only proceed in a small steps and with a complete
                formation.
                It like climb the steps of a Pyramid.
                And you? What good wind take you here?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span> My hobby </span> <br> I think of myself to have a lot of passion, maybe it depends by my
                philantropic
                way to live the
                life. <br>
                My main hobby is Yoga, it the bridge beetween pshysical world and inner, psychic world. It help me to
                front the my days with a mindful mood. <br>
                The others regards the art world: i love to write poetry, sing song, play the clarinet, paint astract
                draw (obiosvly I'm not an expert), but all this requer a lot of time. <br>
                Last but not less important is the trekking: the contact with nature help me to find my motivation when
                I'm lose: the major artist on our path of existence is Mother Nature!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span> What I think of my self </span> <br>
                I want to be honest regard my defect: I'm a very <a href="#">heavy</a> people that stay all the time
                observe
                everything around me. I'm an analytic person, everytime I go deeply, it is like I love bring light in
                the darkness.
                My favourite side of me is dynamism and creativity: I'm full of <a href="#">stimuli</a>, my days
                aren't never boring!
